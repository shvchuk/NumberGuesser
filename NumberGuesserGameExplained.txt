   guesses left will be decreased by one.

    1. we need a variable that stores the secret number
    2. we need to set the range ex. range 0 - 100
    3. the range should be outputted to the player
    4. we need a variable that stores the number of guesses the player has left
    5. we need a variable that will store the players guess
